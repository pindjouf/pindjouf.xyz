I don't think I've mentioned this on here before but, I'm loosely following the [fromthetransistor](https://github.com/pindjouf/fromthetransistor) course here and there when I have the time and energy.  
Obviously, I've made this work correctly so I know how to do it. But I wanted to write this down to see how well I could articulate the concepts I've learned.

The first place I went to was [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_asynchronous_receiver-transmitter) and I found this exact diagram.

It made the concept of a shift register much clearer and gave me the blueprint on what I should be working on to make it happen. The first thing this inspired me to make was a D flip flop which I learned about in this [article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flip-flop_(electronics)) and by doing some [exercises](https://hdlbits.01xz.net/wiki/Dff) on [HDLBits](https://hdlbits.01xz.net/wiki/Main_Page). This [ressource](https://grace.bluegrass.kctcs.edu/~kdunn0001/files/Flip_Flops/Flip_Flops_print.html) was also very helpful to my understanding of flip flops and latches.

## D Flip-flop

This is the first thing I had to implement because it's the main piece of the puzzle. The flip flop is what holds the data in transit, it's a very basic form of memory. Here's my dff module in verilog:

```verilog
module dff (
    input d,
    input clk,
    input reg reset,
    output reg q
);

always @ (posedge clk or negedge clk) begin
    if (reset) begin
        q <= 1'b0;
    end else begin
        q <= d;
    end
end
    
endmodule
```

You can see how this closely reflects the flip flops in the previous image, the only thing that's missing here is the ***set*** input, but it's not something that I felt was necessary for our use case so I simply decided not to include it. As you can see it's pretty simple, the output `q` updates to match the input `d` at **posedge** or **negedge** of **clk**, unless **reset** is active high, in which case `q` is set to `0`.

## SIPO

As the name states (Serial-in parallel-out) the goal of this register is to take serial data and convert it to parallel. Meaning, it will come in bit-by-bit and come out as a data block.

To hold values, I implemented a simple wire called `hold_value` and used ternary operators on the flip flop instantiations' input `d` pins, that serves as a multiplexer that choses between shifting in new data or *recycling* its own output.

Here's my SIPO module in verilog:

```verilog
module sipoUnit #(parameter WIDTH = 8) (
    input wire data_in,
    input wire hold_value,
    input wire reset,
    input wire clk,
    output reg [WIDTH-1:0] q
);

    dff dff0 (
        .d(hold_value ? q[0] : data_in),
        .reset(reset),
        .clk(clk),
        .q(q[0])
        );

    generate
        for (genvar i = 0; i < WIDTH-1; i++) begin
            dff dff_inst (
                .d(hold_value ? q[i+1] : q[i]),
                .reset(reset),
                .clk(clk),
                .q(q[i+1])
            );
        end
    endgenerate

endmodule
```

I feel that there is nothing else to add. Really, the SIPO register seemed daunting to me at first but when I started breaking the pieces down it became clearer what the next implementation should be.
