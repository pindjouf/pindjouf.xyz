# Belgian SFG Training Program

**[Skip to Program Section](#program-section)**

I summarized the training for the Q-Course in a readable format because the official document is quite overwhelming.

I believe that all the information in it is valuable but I want to have a version of it that just has the program in it without the explanation.

If you want to get the philosophy and reasoning behind the structure of the program then you should definitely read the [official document.](http://www.sfg.be/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/I7PmuBTln1.pdf)

I will finish the preface with this. The reason why I have to follow this program is simple. I've lost a futsal game, this has deeply hurt me as this loss is entirely my fault. I should've been a fitter, stronger, faster player. This loss has resulted in the oppososing being happy and proud, this doesn't sit well with me as I could've been better and changed the entire course of the game.

As "Punishment" I've decided to go run a 20K even though I haven't ran in a while, it will get me thinking right again because I've totally let myself go. Losing is not okay and it is entirely within my grasp to stop this.

I also believe that knowing you're ready (physically) to end 99% of people's lives is an important feeling. One would need Strategy, Map Reading Skills, and incredible Weapon Manipulation Skills, etc... to get that figure to 99.9%. But I believe that just by being mentally ready and able to outlast people by a ridiculous amount is already beneficial enough, although the other pursuits are also of incredible interest to me. I have to be ready for the next opportunity.

By the way the WODs (workouts of the day) are detailed in the [official document.](http://www.sfg.be/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/I7PmuBTln1.pdf) I just didn't want to make this too long.
