# Attention & Peace

I was having a conversation recently with a close family member, and she brought up a very special subject. She met a man that didn't have a mobile phone. Crazy concept in 2024, but it's one that fascinates me. I had that conversation with her a few days ago, but this is something that hasn't left my mind since. No mobile phone... Imagine the peace of living such a life. I just read this [X article](https://x.com/LukasHozda/status/1860442337534468333) by [@LukasHozda](https://x.com/LukasHozda) and it's beautiful, I let the ideas simmer for a couple minutes, talked to myself about it and decided I should put some thoughts on "paper". A lot of the concepts he laid out I've found to be working in my life (back when I followed them). But lately I've been lacking attention and focus, that's what hooked me on the article and I'm glad it did!

## You do not have to be available 24/7

The reason the man with no mobile phone (let's call him Carl) popped back up in my mind is because the article mentions a similar concept. But before addressing that, let's look at Carl's reasoning for not having a mobile phone. He claims that whenever he isn't home it means he's not available, he's doing something, therefore there is no point in contacting him because he's busy. This makes total sense to me, what's the point of having constant notifications, messages & calls if you're already occupied with something else? Unless it's an emergency, you can't free yourself to "help out with something" or "have a quick chat". You are busy. If you're a serious person it's higly probable that you follow a schedule, having people constantly trying to knock you off that path by virtually summoning you, is annoying. Not only do you get off schedule by letting yourself be consumed by those things but it also drains your mental energy. A quote that perfectly summarizes this (although in another context) is the following:

> “What information consumes is rather obvious: it consumes the attention of its recipients. Hence a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention, and a need to allocate that attention efficiently among the overabundance of information sources that might consume it.”  
― **Herbert Simon**

The benefits of Carl's method are immeasurable, first of all it lends well to a life that is carefully planned, in the following ways; You are never bothered while carrying out the tasks on your schedule, people that want to see you have a dedicated amount of time each day to "book" a time with you, you have segmented time for work and leisure! With this, you shift most of the responsibility of having a productive day to yourself. Which is something that should overjoy you, and if it doesn't, you're slacking and have lots of work to do, figure out how to fix that situation and follow the advice in this article.

[@LukasHozda's](https://x.com/LukasHozda) advice ties in well with this, because he recommends always being on do not disturb during in your periods of work. I quote this directly from the article:

> The 24/7 nature of digital communication creates social pressure to be constantly available. This prevents the deep rest and boredom necessary for attention restoration.

This is beautifully put. What really caught my eye is the last sentence. "*We need deep rest and boredom to restore attention?*" The deep rest part is obvious, but the claim about boredom intrigued me. As it's something I'd already heard in passing, I decided to keep it in mind to research later. Come to find out I didn't need research because right after reading the article, I just took the time to sit there and let the information simmer like I mentioned at the start of this article. And once I came back to the computer I could feel a certain clarity that wasn't there before. A certain ease working with ideas in my mind and feeling fully in control of what I thought and how I was gonna act about it. That's enough proof for me that boredom and idleness are perfectly fine ways to restore attention and mental energy.

## Draining mental energy & attention

Most of us feel perfectly refreshed and full of energy after a good night's rest, and lose that throughout the day up until we're tired and ready to go to bed. We often think of this in terms of physically being tired and ready to rest. But the same can be said for our brains as well, which should gradually lose energy as the day goes on. Unfortunately that's not the case, because most of us are not using our brain in sensible ways. We expose it to multitasking (context switching), brainrot and constant decision making (by lack of proper planning). This basically drains our mental energy as soon as we start the day, and then we go on with heavy brain fog and no real time to restore all the energy we've lost in the morning.

### Routine

A simple way to minimize the amount of daily decisions you have to make is to have some sort of routine. I think it's pretty obvious that someone with a schedule who only has to wake up - perform their prepared tasks - go to sleep will conserve much more energy and attention than someone who constantly has to think, **what next?** By limiting the number of decisions you have to make, you not only save energy but you can also decide to allocate that energy to more important tasks. See when you start using these techniques you'll find yourself in a position of attention management, as opposed to being a slave to your impulses.

### Breaks

During breaks you can choose to totally reset and disengage from everything related to the task you're taking a break from, or take the time to do things that relax you. Breaks should restore energy and attention, not drain it further. That's why things like social media brainrot are no good, some think that it's a good way to pass time but it really doesn't bring anything valuable to your life. It doesn't matter if you find a funny meme or video, none of those moments bring you anything, they're not memorable and they leave you without assisting in your energy or attention recovery. A more sensible way to spend that time, if you decide to relax with an activity as opposed to sitting or walking with an idle mind, would be to choose an activity that you enjoy. Depending on what your environment allows you should do something that you like, an easy one would be reading, if you're a reader carrying that around is easy, bringing it to a workplace is fine. You could jam on your instrument if you're someone that works from home for example. But this time should really be sacred and not poluted by something that drains your energy further!

### Flowing

As hard as it is to get into it sometimes, you can't reach for a quick distraction to keep you stimulated, that's only gonna reset that initial focusing period.

Directly quoting from the article:

> Studies show that it takes like half an hour (if I recall correctly? Thereabouts) to fully regain focus after an interruption.

He's not sure about the half hour figure, and neither am I. But I think any person that has ever tried to refocus after context switching can attest to the fact that it's far from being immediate. Try building the habit of staying on task no matter how boring or difficult it gets. I don't have all the solutions as I'm still struggling heavily with this one myself, but some concepts I learned recently have been helping me get better.

#### Break it down

Whenever I get stuck now I try to convert problems/concepts/ideas from abstract & complex to detailed & simple. I won't spend too much time on this since I'm probably going to write an article on it later, and you can find glimpses of it already in [this one](https://pindjouf.xyz/posts/day_3), where I use it to figure out how to make a baud rate generator. But really the gist of it, is to figure out the next step. If you want to make a website, but don't know how to write html, your next step whould be to just write an `<html>` tag, figure that out and go from there. Make the next step so easy that it would be ridiculous not to do it.

## Space segmentation

Since we've talked about what drains our mental energy and our attention, let's learn how to restore it. I've already covered a few ways, so let's focus on the one that has the biggest impact on me. Segment your work and leisure spots, it could even be extended to segmenting your leisure and "recharging" spots but that might be too much. Whenever I lock in on my productivity, I find myself doing this naturally. Having dedicated places creates a trigger for your brain to switch when you enter that room. Ideally you'd remove all distractions from that room, no phone in there or at least put it far away so it's tedious to get to it. Often it's not our need to be stimulated that distracts us by itself, it's the ease of access to it. If you had to pay 3% of your net worth every time you wanted to context switch and use your phone as a means of distraction you'd think about it twice. That's why keeping it far away is very effective at preserving your attention, if you put people in a room where there's nothing else to do but work, you'll often find that they will choose to work over boredom. Our brains crave stimulation so if work is the only entertainment in town we'll settle for it! And by the way you can't train yourself to not care about having your phone near you, the mere fact that it's present and close in proximity makes your brain work NOT to touch it, so by forcing yourself to leave it alone you're still expending mental energy.
