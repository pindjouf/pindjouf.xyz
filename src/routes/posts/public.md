# Publicly Passionate

If you know me, you know that I change passions every ~6-12 months. I will abandon everything and start spending all my time doing that one thing. It's always been treated as a problem by myself and others, but I think it's because I've been doing it wrong. I've never shared my passion with anyone to the degree that I see other people do it.

## Keeping records

There are multiple things I've gotten deeply involved in, without ending up with anything to show for it.  

A perfect example is how I started playing electric guitar in 2020, I started with all the basic stuff by learning the classic easy songs and riffs. But shortly thereafter I found out about metal, and after that I discovered *"neoclassical metal"*, notably Yngwie Malmsteen. I got obssessed with that playing style so I started studying everything around that and practicing the same techniques over and over, spending days perfecting little passages, forgetting to feed myself and barely going outside at times.  

It was a good time, I liked it. Only thing is that I have nothing to show for it today, I haven't practiced for well over two years and I can barely play a song, because I've never learned any. That's what you miss by getting involved in things by yourself. If I'd explored that period with other like-minded people I would've discovered the joys of jamming, making songs, playing covers together. Those are things that would've had a more long lasting impact, I'd probably still know how to play a couple songs, have pictures and videos of concerts at small venues perhaps and I'd have people to contact if I wanted to go over memories or get back into it!  

When you do things by yourself, the impact of those things is way smaller by definition. And that's totally fine sometimes, but it's not something to make a lifestyle out of. Everything is temporary by nature, but in some ways, keeping things to yourself feels like they've never existed/happened sometimes. So as an effort to experience more life I'll start being *publicly passionate*, as the title says.

## Finally going east

Most of these realizations came to me since I've been here in Asia for the first time. I've been traveling solo for the better part of a year now and it's always been simple as they were trips of relaxation, that never lasted longer than a week. So I'd be fine being by myself, occasionaly meeting seomeone new here and there, but for the most part I felt at ease being solo.  

Things are different on this trip since I'm in new territory, I'd previously only traveled inside Europe where things weren't so different to what I'm used to, and like I said they were short trips in a way different context.  

Here I've learned that when you're around total strangers the best way to connect is to find common ground, that's always been difficult for me because I genuinely do not care about most things/people. I just found out that the only way to pique my curiosity and make myself want to meet and learn about mfs is if we share an interest! When I'm in front of someone that has way more knowledge than I do about something I love, I will automatically be interested in a conversation, which in turn makes it easier to connect with that person. Because that's what you always hear in those self help books right, be interested in people and they will love you for it.  

I'll start being unapologetically involved in my interests and politely decline anything that I don't care about (most things). I think that it's a childish way to experience life but that's where I'm at currently, perhaps it'll change in the near future.

Asia is cool af btw, I'll probably make a post about that trip later.

## Final notes

So for those in my condition, my advice would be to publicize your passions. Even if it doesn't make too much sense sometimes, I get that you want to work on circuit design at home but sometimes it's okay to go to an event and talk to mfs about azure and containers. The idea is to bring more love into your life, and you do that by experiencing the things you love more, with more people, with more passion. Like Yngwie said *more is more* :D. Otherwise you'll be frustrated that you can't find the same bliss everyone seems to be experiencing.

## 2nd final notes

There should only be one final note? I got boffum, deal with it.  

Find places that play the music you listen to on spotify, who's building this??

### Braindump about how I'm going about this

- **Guitar/music**
    - Go to venues that match the vibe/genre you like
    - Go to music shops to meet the mfs that make/take care of the instrument(s) you like and other players.
    - Festivals/concerts if u can find them

- **Bodybuilding/powerlifting/combat sports**
    - The gym obviously
    - The gym obviously
