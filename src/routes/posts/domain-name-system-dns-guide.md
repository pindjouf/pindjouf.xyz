As promised in my last article, I will show you the technical aspect of passive information gathering/recon. However, I don't want to rush and simply brush over topics that are as important as DNS for instance, which is our topic of the day. I want to dive into its inner workings and explore all it has to offer since it's the main component of our attack surface. I say this because without it, we have nothing to look into. It's our main gateway into discovering the attack surface since it reveals subdomains, IPs and other infra details. You can't look into something you haven't found, can you?

I will make this a multipart series so that we have the time to truly cover all the aspects of our subjects. I felt that DNS deserved it's own article, but the next one will probably cover more topics, like the application itself and all its moving parts for instance.

## What is DNS fundamentally?

We'll start the article at a high level and dive deeper as we go by building on our foundation. Keeping with the **input -> system -> output**[[ยน]](https://youtu.be/N2bXEUSAiTI?si=Z9d1Wtpeh8K2ikzK&t=912) theme, we'll think of DNS as a black box for now. What we have to figure out first is what it takes (input), and what the system gives back after it's done (output).

An abstract way to address those two points is to see DNS as a system that takes human-friendly computer hostnames (often referred to as domain names) and converts them to IP addresses.

Keep this in mind as we go into more detail because you might feel lost at some point. But with this reference point, you'll have a fundamental understanding from first principles that prevents any unnecessary confusion.  

### Why do we need DNS?

I'd like to go on a brief tangeant about **why** we use DNS. Similarly to a compiler, the DNS's main purpose is to help humans interact with their machines. In the way that it allows us to input something that is easy for us to understand, and translate it to something that is easy for the machine to understand. So what's the problem and how does DNS solve it? Well as you could've guessed, it's practically impossible (or very difficult) to remember the IP addresses of all the internet services we use. And machines don't understand anything other than said IP addresses. So we bridge the gap by using DNS.

#### Abstraction

Although `domain name -> IP` is the primary purpose of it, DNS helps us in many other ways. For instance, it abstracts away the underlying infrastructure by always pointing to an entities' machines. Say a company migrates their servers to a different hosting provider for example. You'd still use the same `example.com` domain, whether their address is `104.218.63.175` or `23.154.89.126` because they would make sure that their domain name always points to it. You can think of it as pattern-matching, here's a code snippet to illustrate this (omitting the actual resolution, we cover this later in the article):

```rust
use std::net::Ipv4Addr;

enum HostingProvider {
    Epik,
    AWS,
}

fn get_server_ip(domain_name: &str, hosting_provider: HostingProvider) -> (String, Ipv4Addr) {
    let ip_address = match hosting_provider {
        HostingProvider::Epik => Ipv4Addr::new(104, 218, 63, 175),
        HostingProvider::AWS => Ipv4Addr::new(23, 154, 89, 126)
    };

    (domain_name.to_string(), ip_address)
}

fn main() {
    let domain_name = "example.com";

    let (domain, ip1) = get_server_ip(domain_name, HostingProvider::Epik);
    println!("{} points to {}", domain, ip1);

    let (domain, ip2) = get_server_ip(domain_name, HostingProvider::AWS);
    println!("{} points to {}", domain, ip2);

}
```

This practice can be done manually by handling what we call DNS records yourself, or automatically through the use of Dynamic DNS. But let's not get carried away here.

#### Load balancing and scalability

Another way DNS proves to be useful is by helping servers manage load, which makes it more scalable since it can handle billions of queries without overwhelming any single server. Like we learned in the section above, one domain doesn't necessarily mean one machine. So DNS can also act as some sort of router, which improves performance both for the user (by routing them to geographically closer servers to reduce latency) and for the servers (by distributing the queries to prevent overload).

## How does DNS work?

Now that we understand the core of DNS, we can explore its hierarchical and distributed nature. And start looking into **how** it actually works.

### A hierarchical and distributed nature

### socket

</div>

You can think of sockets as a place two mfs agree to meet at to communicate.
As illustrated by this image, you can see that two mfs are just relaxing right in there. Because that's the purpose of sockets, they're comfy endpoints for apps & processes to send and receive data through. Just like in a normal conversation, people can talk at the same time that's also the case for sockets since they're full-duplex which means that they allow for simultaneous bidirectional data transfer between client and server, contrary to traditional client-server applications

great definition:

> A socket is an abstraction through which an application may send and receive data,in much the same way as an open file allows an application to read and write data to stable storage. A socket allows an application to "plug in" to the network and communicate with other applications that are also plugged in to the same network. Information written to the socket by an application on one machine can be read by an application on a different machine, and vice versa.
