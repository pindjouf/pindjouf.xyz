# Assumption-based learning

Thinking allows us to make semi-accurate predictions about the outcomes that a series of actions lead to. Thus saving us from a lot of trouble.

That's why I think taking inspiration from that can lead me to learning more quickly. In the style of *"if this is true then this must work in that way."* This mode of thinking allows us to work with information we don't have, which is often the case when learning something totally new.
