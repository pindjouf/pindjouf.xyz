- *Most things are already good enough, you just have to learn how to use them.*

## Job Search Framework

### LinkedIn

- Contact recruiters gently (hi x I see that you have an open position for y) -> ask where you can send CV -> send CV ASAP where they told you

- Contact recruiters directly with enthusiastic mail -> cover letter + CV

## How Recruiters Work

- They call to get to know you -> write down most intereseting parts.
- Contact their client to sell you.
- If client likes it you get an interview.
