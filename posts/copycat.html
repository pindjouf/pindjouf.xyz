    <h1>Copycat</h1>
    <p><b>TLDR: I learn best by copying cracked people.</b></p>
    <p>Anything I've ever wanted to get good at I've always found a role model that I just want to emulate, that's why sometimes my endeavors don't seem clear it's because they're predefined by someone else and since I trust in their knowledge more than anyone else's I just follow blindly without questioning!</p>
    <p>I really learn like a child, it's a simple process.</p>
    <p>Anything that my idol does I do.</p>
    <p>And that's why when I'm not focused on following an idol I usually give up the endeavor.</p>
    <p>I'll take someone's opinions and call them my own, and the craziest thing is that people applaud you for it (when they don't know). Like you can base your whole personality on someone else and if the person in front of you doesn't know them they'd think you were amazing. That's why I think it's great to take inspiration from people in all areas of life.</p>
    <p>Like in any public facing profession, interviewers always ask the subjects who their inspirations were. I think it's fair to be like that about anything in life really, your comedy, your way of talking, your habitual phrases can all come from different people and the sum of all of that is YOU. In that, you're also directly sharing the experiences you've had in life.</p>
    <p>It's like built-in storytelling.</p>
    <p>And as such you won't have to do any spiritual soul-searching to understand yourself, you'll just have to ask a series of logical questions!</p>
    <p>I'll use an idea that George Hotz presented in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2bXEUSAiTI&t">video</a></p>
    <p>input -> system -> output</p>
    <p>If I find someone that's getting the output that I want and we're using the same system, why would I waste my time trying to figure out the right input when they've already found the recipe?</p>
    <p>To make it more concrete and use an example from the video.</p>
    <p>We can turn:</p>
    <p>input -> system -> output</p>
    <p>into:</p>
    <p>rizz -> girl -> girlfriend/wife</p>
    <p>It's the only shortcut to getting cracked at anything.</p>
    <p>The advantage of working backwards FROM the output is that you can move fast</p>
    <p>Once you know where you're going there are no more questions to ask yourself besides "how do I move past that sticking point?" Iterate for a while and boom goal achieved, super tof.</p>
    <p>At some point you'll arrive to your desired skill level and that's when you'll be able to create in your image and stop copying. You should only use people for inspiration at that point. Not like a blueprint to follow anymore.</p>
    <p>So my procedure for when I get new interests is the following (I think).</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Define my favorite parts of a subject.</li>
        <li>Find someone that does it at the highest level.</li>
        <li>Investigate them to confirm my attention is well placed.</li>
        <li>Copy & Paste all their philosophies/opinions on the subject to your brain.</li>
        <li>Do everything they did to get to that point if it's documented, else just follow their advice/figure it out yourself.</li>
        <li>Become them, in that area of your life.</li>
    </ul>
