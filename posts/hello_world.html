    <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
    <p>This post is an introduction to my page.</p>
    <p>My goal is to make it a log of my thoughts and goals while providing valuable insights. <br> Although some might think that simple content such as the one on this page might be outdated, I think it still has it's place. In a world full of overstimulation it can be a quiet place to truly digest information.
    </p>
    <p>It will also be a log of how retarded I get sometimes. But those are the times I'm most dedicated to a cause even if it doesn't make any sense, it's worth the experience.
    </p>
    <p>This is far from being a logical place, it's more of an open source diary. -_-</p>
