    <p>Question of the day: How to stop this cycle and follow through despite feeling lost?</p>
    <p>
        The crazy thing is how simple it actually is to make progress and succeed in life yet so few people are capable of it, why is that? 
    </p>
    <p>
        I don’t know about others but I know that I always get stuck and give up after getting frustrated with a problem I can’t solve, when I don’t know how to take the next step I just get analysis paralysis which is dumb because the only thing keeping me from moving forward is my lack of knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
        It only takes a few minutes, hours, days of learning to come back to a problem with the solution and solve it. Repeat that cycle and you’ll have gotten so far that you won’t even remember the impact those problems had on you that’s literally how you progress on all fronts in life.

    <ol style="line-height: 135%;">
        <li>Set a goal</li>
        <li>Plan accordingly</li>
        <li>Work with current knowledge</li>
        <li>Face new problem</li>
        <li>Find solution to problem</li>
    </ol>
    <p>See how simple it is? Step 1 & 2 are just there to start a project but the real cycle is the 3, 4, 5.</p>
    <p>Please never lose track of that or you’ll keep getting lost, planning & failing for eternity.</p>
    <p>
        I get excited and happy when things go right / according to plan but sad when they don’t so in the name of excitement I will now focus on this plan to stop losing hope.
