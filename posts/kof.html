# 10 Days For Kof

In ten days I finish my cybersecurity bootcamp, I have nothing to show for it.\
So I will make sure to have something to show in ten days.

Everything in my life will be on standby until kof gets done.

George Hotz said that the best way to learn how to code is to keep pushing on a project, so here I am pushing on a project.

idk rust, but it seems cool for encryption. kof needs encryption, so I'm doing it in rust.

## MVP

### Features

Timestamped journal entries with \`kof --create\` or \`create\`. -> Title of doc = date of creation
Main entries in **main.md** file with \`kof --main\` or \`main\`. -> Title of doc = *"Things to keep in mind"*
File syncing on self-hosted server or on the Noir Chapeau Cloud with \`kof --sync\`.
File Encryption for repos that are stored in the cloud.

## Gameplan

**Day 1:** get familiar with rust -> [cli with rust](https://rust-cli.github.io/book/index.html)\
**Day 2-9:** build\
**Day 10:** make banger linkedin post, article on personal blog and poast on X (formerly twitter) -> "what started as a joke now serves as an outlet for actual projects" when talking about [noirchapeau.com](https://noirchapeau.com)

*kof is being built at Noir Chapeau Labs*
